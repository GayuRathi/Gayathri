To create a calendar-like date picker in HTML where only weekdays (Monday to Friday) are enabled for selection, you can use the `<input type="date">` element along with some JavaScript to disable weekends. Here's a basic example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Booking Tool</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Booking Tool</h1>
    <form>
        <label for="booking_date">Select a date (Monday to Friday only):</label><br>
        <input type="date" id="booking_date" name="booking_date" required><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Book">
    </form>

    <script>
        // Function to disable weekends in the date picker
        function disableWeekends() {
            var inputDate = document.getElementById('booking_date');
            inputDate.addEventListener('input', function() {
                var selectedDate = new Date(this.value);
                var dayOfWeek = selectedDate.getDay();
                if (dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6) {
                    alert('Please select a date from Monday to Friday.');
                    this.value = ''; // Clear the selected date
                }
            });
        }

        // Call the function to disable weekends
        disableWeekends();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code:

- We have a `<form>` containing a label and an `<input type="date">` element for selecting a date.
- We use JavaScript to add an event listener to the date input field. When a date is selected (`input` event), the script checks if it's a Saturday or Sunday (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday). If it is, an alert is shown to the user, and the selected date is cleared.
- The `disableWeekends()` function is called to set up the event listener when the page loads.

This code ensures that only weekdays (Monday to Friday) can be selected in the date picker.
